# Python library to control BenQ projectors

Python library to control BenQ projectors over the serial interface.

BenQ projectors and flat pannels with a serial port can support one of three
protocols. This plugin supports projectors which are of the L, P, T, W and X
series but probably also others.

## Protocol

This are the protocol details:

2400 baud 8N1

```
<CR>*<key>=<value>#<CR>
```

Where `<CR>` is a Carriage Return

Examples:  
Power on   : `<CR>*pow=on#<CR>`  
Power off  : `<CR>*pow=off#<CR>`  
Source HDMI: `<CR>*sour=hdmi#<CR>`  

The same commands should work over a network connection, but I don't own such
projector and have not implemented any network functionality. Contact me if
you have a network connected BenQ projector and like this to work.

### PJLink

This library does **not** implement the PJLink protocol, but a proparitary
BenQ protocol instead. The PJLink protocol is covered by other libraries.

## Supported projectors

Known to work:
* W1070
* W1100
* W1110
* X3000i

Not tested but use te same protocol according to the documentation:  
Others in the L, P, T, W and X Series

Not supported:
* RP552
* RP552H
* RP840G
* RP653
* RP703
* RP750
* RP750K
* RP652
* RP702
* RP790S
* RP705H

Please let me know if your projectors is also supported by this plugin so I
can improve the overview of supported devices.

## Installation
You can install the Python BenQ projector library using the Python package
manager PIP:  
`pip3 install benqprojector`

## benqprojector CLI
You can use the Python BenQ projector library directly from the command line
to turn on and off your projector using the following syntax:

Status of the projector: `python3 -m benqprojector <serial port> <baud> status`  
Turn on the projector: `python3 -m benqprojector <serial port> <baud> on`  
Turn off the projector: `python3 -m benqprojector <serial port> <baud> off`

### Detecting your projector capabilities
The benqprojector CLI can detect the commands, sources and modes your
projector supports. If you like to have your projector fully supported by this
Python library please run this command and create an issue on Github with the
output attached.

To examine your projector capabilities: `python3 -m benqprojector <serial port> <baud> examine`

Your projector needs to be on to be able to detact all your projector
capabilities.
